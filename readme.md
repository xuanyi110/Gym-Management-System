# La Habana Fitness

## Project Description

La Habana Fitness is an application to manage the gym. It stores the information of customers, staff, fitness machines, areas, fitness courses, etc. The application assists to manage the normal workflow and provides rich information to its users.

The application is capable of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data inside the tables. It also supports advanced and complicated business logic, such as purchasing memberships, registering courses, and choosing meal plans, etc.

The project uses MySQL as the DBMS and NodeJS as the backend; in the same time, HTML/CSS files are used to create a simple user interface.

## Software requirements & dependencies

1. Node https://nodejs.org/en/download/ OR Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

2. Install all the project dependencies by executing `yarn` or `npm install` on the command line.

3. Install MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

## Run the application

1. Run the MySQL DBMS and create a new database called "gym_management_system".

2. For the newly created database, run all the SQL queries inside the `DDL.sql` file once. This will create all the tables and sample data we need in the application.

3. Type the following command to run the node server and start the application:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. Open the `home.html` file in the repo by broswer and you are all set!
